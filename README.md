## üìù Introduction

Agriculture plays a crucial role in feeding the growing global population. However, challenges such as climate change, limited resources, and inefficient farming practices have a significant impact on agricultural productivity. This project aims to address these challenges by applying data science techniques to optimize various aspects of agricultural production.

## üõ† Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the results, the following dependencies are required:

- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- ipywidgets

All dependencies can be installed by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## üíª Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/optimization-agricultural-production.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd optimization-agricultural-production
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # for Unix/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # for Windows
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the desired notebook from the project directory.

3. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and optimization.

4. Refer to the documentation in the notebooks and the code comments for further instructions and details.
